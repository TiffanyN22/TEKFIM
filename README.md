# MyGov by TEKFIM
## About
The purpose of MyGov is to increase civic engagement by making it easier for voters to make informed decision during elections. The first way we do this is by allowing the user to select their state and senator/representative in the house to see what they stand for through the legislation that they have sponsored. In addition, we also have an option for the user to enter in their address and see candidates in their local elections in addition to drop off locations. A full demo of our app can be seen on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/-C8zMWTTHfY)!
MyGov was created using Swift UIKit and Storyboard, in addition to the Congress.gov API for congressional data, Google Civil Information API for local election information, and Google Maps Platform (including geocoding API, places API, and maps static API) to visualize the locations.
